The app will record camera sensor and microphone data, which is used for the purpose of taking photos and recording videos.
No data is shared with anyone.

Location permission is required for geotagging of photos, but this is disabled by default. If enabled, your location is encoded
in the saved image and video files (and it is only used for this purpose). No location data is shared.
